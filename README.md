<a name="why"/>
# Why CloudAcademy?

<a name="communication"/>
# Communication
- Communication is the key differentiator of successful teams
- Direct communication is best
- I have an open door policy
- Email, slack, or call
- Anytime, day or night
- I'll respond as quickly as I can, and if you feel like something could be better, please tell me so
- Remind me if you don't get a prompt answer
- I try to at least set expectations for a response as soon as I see a message

<a name="feedback"/>
# Feedback
- Feedback is a vital to understanding expectations and improving outcomes
- Feedback is bi-directional
- Direct is better than subtle
- Frequent is better than formal
- It's safe to talk to me about anything - I abhor retaliation

<a name="11"/>
# 1:1s
- Initially, I schedule 1:1s once a week - then adjust frequency as needed
- Your time to talk - please feel free to bring up anything

<a name="empowerment"/>
# Empowerment
- People who feel empowered deliver powerful results
- If there's no clear policy on something, do what you think is right

<a name="worklife"/>
# Work / Life
- I may email or IM you outside of work hours
- Unless I clearly indicate it's an emergency, if I reach out to you via IM or email outside of work hours, feel free to ignore me until next day
- If I call you outside of work hours, this means it's an emergency and a rare event - I'll treat this as a last resort

<a name="wrong"/>
# When things go wrong
- Finding the root cause and improving processes is the only way to do better next time
- I use [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) to help determine root cause
- Feel free to talk openly about what went wrong - I'm never looking to blame anyone, just improve the process

<a name="flame"/>
# F.L.A.M.E.
A process I use to help triage and resolve problems of any size - feel free to use them yourself!
## Find Out
- Find out the facts
- What is the primary question?
- Who is involved?
- When did the problem start/incident occur?
- Who is it impacting?
## Listen
- Listen to all parties to ensure that all stakeholders have had a chance to be heard and give their input
## Analyze
- Once you have gathered all the information that you can, analyze it
- Take all of the facts that you gathered during the F and L parts of the process and consider your understanding of the technical and product ramifications of the matter at hand
## Mediate
- Work with all parties involved until an outcome is reached that seems to function well
- Whenever possible, facilitate the parties reaching their own joint solution
- People are much more likely to stick to a solution when they feel ownership of the process and that the resolution came from them
## Explain
- Explain the outcome of the mediation process to everyone involved, ensuring that all parties have come to a consensus and we have a clear path forward
